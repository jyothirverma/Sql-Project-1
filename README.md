SQL Project: Online Music Store Analysis

This is my first SQL project, focused on analyzing data from an online music store. The objective of this project is to explore a music playlist database using SQL and extract meaningful insights that help the business understand customer behavior and overall performance.

In this project, I worked with an 11-table relational database to perform SQL-based analysis on sales transactions, customer demographics, playlist composition, and artist performance, deriving actionable business insights. The project is designed at a beginner level and demonstrates how SQL can be used to answer real-world business questions and support data-driven decision-making.

This project helped me strengthen my foundational SQL skills, including data filtering, aggregations, joins, and basic analytical techniques.
